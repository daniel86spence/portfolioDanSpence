#Project Title: Dan Spence Portfolio

#Purpose: This is my first portfolio website to share the projects I am developing as part of my software engineering journey

###Description:
At the time of creating this project, I have completed 30% of the Codecademy full-stack engineering career path. The latest learning project is to design a responsive website to showcase my 'off-platform' projects, utilising deployments to Github.

The site is built on HTML, CSS and Javascript, ensuring that a clean layout is implemented with instances of responsiveness.

I have built three main areas of the site:
- About
- Projects
- Contact

Each area is accessed through a navbar in the header.

I have utilised 3 functions, one for each areas of the site, and each function is called at the onclick event of each of the navbar options. When the onlick event is triggered, the display paramater for the 'clicked' element will revert to 'block', and the other two will revert to 'none, thsu only displaying the clicked element in the front-end.

I have utilised :hover to change the colour of the nav option, to change to 'blue' and cursor as 'pointer' when hovering over each.

The about page contains a basic introduction to me.

The projects page contains a number of off-platform projects completed. Each project has been split in to a JS Class to structure with a 'name', 'month of completion', 'description', and 'key skill'. 

The contact page shows my key contact details
